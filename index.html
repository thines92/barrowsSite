      <p>
        Jared Robert Barrows and twin Jeffrey Paul Barrows were born on July 22, 1983. They grew up in Marshfield and attended Marshfield
        schools, proudly graduating from Marshfield High School in 2002. From the beginning, Jared had an exceptional talent for making
        others laugh. He was caring, loving and had an abundance of friends who he adored, and they adored him back.
        <br><br>
        After high school, Jared and Jeffrey both attended Nichols College in Dudley, MA. In his sophomore year, Jared decided to major in Art
        and Graphic Design. He transferred to Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH to pursue his dream. Jared was due to graduate in
        May of 2007. Sadly, 3 weeks before graduation, Jared was assaulted on his way back to his dormitory by another student. He
        sustained a brain injury and remained in a coma for 5 days, before passing away on April 20th, 2007.
        <br><br>
        This Foundation was created in Jared's memory. Because of his kindness, generosity and love for Marshfield, I have no doubt in my
        mind that he would have wanted to give back to the Marshfield community where he grew up.
        <br><br>
        Thank You
        <br><br>
        Anna DaVeiga<br>(Jared's Mom)

      <p>
        We have met with town officials, the director of recreation and
        local construction companies. We have decided that the
        foundation's first project is to renovate the basketball courts
        located adjacent to the Marshfield High School. These courts
        are used daily by the local community and after many years of use
        there is significant wear and tear resulting in several severe cracks.
        These cracks are sizable and have become a safety concern. This has forced
        the children's summer program to be relocated.<br><br>
        Several local companies will be donating their equipment and material
        to help make this project happen and with your help we hope to create a
        wonderful, fun, and safe environment for the community to enjoy.<br><br>
        The Jared Barrows Foundation consistently will be giving scholarships out
        annually to graduating seniors off to college, but has a new initiative
        this year which is the basketball court.

      <p>
        Since 2008 we have raised over $10,000. The Jared Barrows Foundation is so thankful for all
        the support thus far, but we still need your help to provide the community with a new, safe
        public basketball court. Your donation will assist us in renovating the basketball courts
        as well as assist a college bound Marshfield senior.<br><br>With your generous donation, you can make
        a difference in the Marshfield community. So act now and contribute what you can!
